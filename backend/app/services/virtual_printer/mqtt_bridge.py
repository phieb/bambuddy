"""MQTT bridge for non-proxy virtual printers.

Mirrors the target printer's state to slicers connected to a virtual printer
without opening a second MQTT session on the printer (reuses Bambuddy's
existing subscription — firmware inflight budget unaffected, see PR #1164).

Architecture (cached-as-base, not a separate fan-out stream):

  - **push_status** snapshots from the printer are CACHED here. The VP's
    `SimpleMQTTServer._send_status_report` consults that cache and sends
    a near-byte-identical copy of the real push to the slicer (with
    sequence_id / gcode_state / etc. overridden). Single source of truth
    keeps BambuStudio's Send pre-flight happy.
  - **info.get_version** responses are also cached so the synthetic version
    response can include the real AMS module list (n3f/n3s/ams entries).
    Without this BambuStudio's Prepare tab labels every AMS as "unknown".
  - **Other command responses** (extrusion_cali_get, AMS write acks,
    xcam responses, …) are fanned out raw to the slicer — they carry
    sequence_ids the slicer is waiting on; the slicer matches and ignores
    unrelated ones.

Identity rewriting at cache time:

  - `upgrade_state.sn` (and any other nested dict's `sn` matching the real
    serial) → VP serial
  - `net.info[*].ip` little-endian uint32 → VP bind IP. BambuStudio reads
    this as the FTP destination IP. Without this the slicer FTPs straight
    to the real printer and bypasses Bambuddy.
  - `ipcam.rtsp_url` is left unchanged: BambuStudio overrides the URL host
    with the device IP it bound to (the VP), so the slicer hits the VP's
    own RTSPS proxy on port 322.

# Bambuddy's internal printer state in bambu_mqtt.py (around line 2686+) is
# updated per-field — each `if "X" in data: self.state.X = ...` block leaves
# every other field untouched, so the state accumulates everything the
# printer has ever sent. The bridge cache below mirrors that pattern: when
# the incoming push_status omits a field, the previous value is preserved
# verbatim; only fields actually present in the new push overwrite. This
# stops capability/lifecycle fields (cali_version, print_type, mc_print_stage,
# device, ...) draining out of the cache between pushalls, which surfaced
# as #1622 (BambuStudio's Device-tab UIs greying out on P1S after the
# cache drained to a thin incremental snapshot). The `ams` field still
# gets unit-/tray-level deep merge via `_merge_ams_dict` because firmware
# sends partial `ams` blobs under the same key (#1387).

    """Merge a new ``ams`` blob from an incremental push onto the previous one.

    Bambu firmware sends three shapes for the ``ams`` field on push_status:

    1. Full pushall (after a printer reconnect or explicit pushall request):
       ``{ams: [{id, tray: [{id, tray_type, ...}, ...]}, ...], ams_status, ams_exist_bits, ...}``
       — every unit + every tray populated.

    2. Status-only incremental: ``{ams_status: 1}`` or ``{humidity: 30}`` —
       no ``ams`` array at all. Bambuddy logs these as "AMS partial update
       (no tray data)" (#784 vintage).

    3. Tray-targeted incremental during a print: ``{ams: [{id: 0, tray:
       [{id: 0, state: 11}]}]}`` — only the units / trays whose state
       changed.

    Replacing the cached ``ams`` wholesale on shapes (2) and (3) is what
    made the slicer "lose" AMS between pushalls and trip the symptom in
    #1387: the slicer would see a stripped ``ams_status``-only blob and
    fall back to its "no AMS" default render. This merge mirrors the
    deep-merge logic in ``bambu_mqtt.py::_handle_ams_data`` at the bridge
    layer so the slicer-facing cache always carries the latest known
    coherent state.

    Strategy:
      - Shallow-merge top-level scalars: keys in ``new`` win; keys only
        in ``prev`` are preserved.
      - For the ``ams`` array (list of units): match by ``id``. Units
        only in ``prev`` survive. Units in ``new`` overlay onto their
        ``prev`` counterpart; same recursion applies to each unit's
        ``tray`` array by tray ``id``.
